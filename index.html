	<h1>Cinque Terre is Now Closed</h1>
	<p class="blurb-wrap">It is with heavy hearts that we bring you this news. After difficult consideration, we have decided to close the doors of Cinque Terre.</p>
	<p class="blurb-wrap">Words cannot describe the gratitude we feel for the continued support of our amazing guests throughout the years. We have always been a family-owned restaurant, and a big part of that is welcoming all of our guests as if they are part of that family. Looking back, we are proud to say that our family has grown tremendously since opening our doors in 2014.</p>
	<p class="blurb-wrap">Whether it was Monday Night Jazz, Karaoke with Sal, Friday nights with Pedro and Siara, or just regulars joining us for dinner, we always looked forward to seeing your familiar faces. Cinque Terre would never have been what it was without all of you.</p>
	<p class="blurb-wrap">Stay safe and healthy, everyone. We love you.</p>
	<p class="blurb-wrap">-Anthony, Pam, and Anthony Jr.</p>
